# Guide for training your AI contender with pytorch


## 1) Create a virtual environment 

I prefer venv, bash, and Linux, you can try Conda, Windows, Powershell if you'd like life to be unnecessarily complicated..

``` bash
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

## 2) Install the requirements
``` bash
pip install -r train-reqs.txt
```

## 3) fire up Jupyter Lab 
``` bash
jupyter lab
```

Enjoy :)
